A website for project documentation can be found on my GitHub page. 
 
The website includes a short description of the projects, its purpose, and its features. Including screenshots and also a portfolio where you can find out more about me.

Having a website for project documentation can provide a more comprehensive and accessible view of the projects I have on GitHub page.
